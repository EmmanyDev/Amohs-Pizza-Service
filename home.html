                <p>&copy This website is the property of Emmanuel Amoh (EmmanyDeveloper) and its design and implementation was done from scratch. Some componets from Youtube videos were upgraded
                     from their simple form and used in the development of this site. I aspire to become a full-stack developer one day, but I enjoy designing the UI of webpages<br>
