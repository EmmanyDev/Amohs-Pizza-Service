# Amohs-Pizza-Service
HTML and CSS mini project that I never got to complete. Had fun with the CSS though!

During the winter break of my first year of college, I wanted to work on a web-based project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to create an interative pizza 
shop where users would fill out a form and that form will have questions about what pizza they want and what toppings. The JavaScript would take that code, and according 
to the user's answers, the program will return a page which will display their receipt along with a warm message telling the user to come again soon.

The home page has two buttons, an Order Pizza button, and an About button. The About button was suppose to be where I talk about the purpose of this web application and 
why I wanted to work on it :D.

I love to code, seriously.

P.S.: This project was created January 3rd, 2020. I'm just pushing this project to github since I want all of my passion projects in one place :D

Enjoy!
